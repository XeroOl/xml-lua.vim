# XML-Lua highlight

This replaces the xml highlighter with one that supports inner lua strings. This is for editing OpenITG/NotITG/Stepmania .xml files that have embedded lua.

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), you can install by adding this to your `init.vim`:
```vim
Plug 'XeroOl/xml-lua.vim'
```
Or similar for other plugin managers.
Otherwise, just add the `syntax/xml.vim` file into your vim's `syntax` folder.
